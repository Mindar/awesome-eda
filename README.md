## <a name="guidelines"></a>PCB Design guidelines/recommendations
Please note that the following guidelines/recommendations are not "official" in any way. They are merely the result of my own experience designing PCBs.
- Add test pads for power, ground and important signals
- Put pin names on the PCB
- Put reference designators for every component on the PCB
- Don't use text smaller than 1mm
- Add more test pads for ground (and other voltages/signals)
- Put polarity icon(s) on the silkscreen next to power connections
- Put min and max voltage on the silkscreen next to power connections
- Put max current on the silkscreen next to power connections
- Put version text on the silkscreen
- Add more (ground) test pads
- Round all pcb corners
- Place M4 mounting holes on diagonal ends of the PCB or preferrably in all 4 corners
- More. Ground. Testpads.
- Use 0603 SMD components wherever possible
- Try to use E12-series resistor, capacitor and inductor values
- Create a BOM containing at least the part's reference designator, part name/number and resistance/capacitance value
